# updated: 24.11.2024 - we keep patients with missing status about recurrency at baseline
#                       we assume that a recurrent patient would have this recorded

# Description
# This script reads the Head & Neck 5000 (HN5000) data and filters the data
# based on the inclusion criteria defined in the BD4QoL study protocol.
# The second part of the code prepares the ordinal categorical variables, 
# replacing the categories by discrete levels
# At the end a csv file is saved with the filtered data.
